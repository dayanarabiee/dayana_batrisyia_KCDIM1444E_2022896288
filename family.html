  <h3>A SON</h3>

<p>
Hello everyone! My name is Dayana Batrisyia Binti Mohd Rabiee, and I am an only child. I was born in Muar, Johor, and I am 20 years old. I am currently pursuing a diploma at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Kedah. I will be completing my diploma in 2025. For now, my family and I live in Puchong, Selangor. Although I was born in Johor, I reside in Selangor. I will also be starting my internship soon in July. I feel excited and can't wait for my internship at the University of Cyberjaya, which is close to my home. That is all about myself.

<h3>MY KING, MY HERO</h3>
<p>
This is the head of our family, Mohd Rabiee bin Mohd Deris. He is a very kind and understanding father to his child and wife. My father works in development management and is very strict and focused on his career. My father was born in Johor and resides in Selangor. He was born on March 10 and is 50 years old, blessed with good health, alhamdulillah. He has faced many challenges, but he has never complained. That is a father's love. I love my father forever until paradise, and may Allah reward his good deeds by granting him entry into paradise. He is my hero!

<h3>MY QUEEN, MY INSPIRATION</h3>

<p>
This is my source of motivation, my mother, Lizawati binti Yaakub. She is a very loving and understanding woman who supports her child through thick and thin. She is the woman who brought me into this world, and I am grateful to have such a beautiful, kind, and youthful mother. My mother was born on August 8 and is 40 years old. I am very fortunate to have a mother who is highly skilled in cooking and business. She was born in Perak and resides in Selangor. She has sacrificed a lot for her child and husband. May Allah reward her good deeds by granting her entry into paradise. May my mother always be healthy and live a happy life forever. She is my source of inspiration.
