  <h3>PRIMARY SCHOOL</h3>

<p>
This is my primary school where I studied for 6 years. Many memories were created here. Hello everyone! This is Putrajaya Precinct 18(1) School where I began learning many things and was very well-educated. I miss returning to my primary school days, there are too many memories with friends, teachers, and the school environment. I miss it so much! The school is experienced, and the teachers are very skilled and knowledgeable.

  <h3>SECONDARY SCHOOL</h3>

<p>
My high school gave me the opportunity and encouragement to become a smarter student and improve my leadership skills. Putrajaya Precinct 18(1) Secondary School provided many sweet memories and nurtured excellent students. I am proud of this school because it offers many opportunities for students to engage in new activities and participate in numerous external programs. The teachers here are highly skilled and excellent; being a teacher is not easy, but the teachers at this school gave me profound memories. I miss the teachers, friends, and the school environment. Everything is just a memory from my 5 years studying here. I hope I can reunite with the educators at this school in the future.

  <h3>UNIVERSITY</h3>

<p>
I am pursuing my diploma at the well-known university, Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Kedah. I am taking a diploma for 2 years and 6 months. This is my first experience being away from my family. I have learned many things here, such as living without water, developing leadership skills, and enjoying cheap food. Daily life includes hand-washing clothes. I have many memories with friends and lecturers, and through various programs, I gained a lot of experience and skills at this university. I am also active in the club and faculty committees to further diversify my skills, making it easier to adapt to working in an organization in the future. I am grateful for the good friends and understanding lecturers around me. The experience of being a student far from home will never be forgotten.
